# JobTrain Coding Bootcamp Issue Tracking

This project is for the JobTrain Coding Bootcamp team to keep track of their tasks and issues using GitHub issue tracking.

For each weekly sprint a text file will be used to keep track of class goals, tasks and issues.

Each project team should also create a weekly sprint file either in this repo or in their team's project repo.
